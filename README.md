# Scalable Data Science- Technical University of Berlin

The goal of the project is to process various data using various data mining tasks with Scala and Apache Spark.

### Tools
* Language: Scala, Java, Python
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Google Colab
* Build tool: Maven
* Apache Spark, Spark SQL and GeoSpark


The project is decomposed into the following sub tasks

### [1. Classification](https://github.com/htefera/Scalable-Data-Science-Assignment-2/tree/master/Classification)


Approach

1. We read the CSV files as dataframe and add a column “spam” to denote if the read record is spam or not
1. We union training records for spam and no spam into a single dataframe, the same operation is done for the training set too.
1. We normalize the email text, we apply normalization a
2. construct a pipeline to apply the transformation 
### [2. Clustering](https://github.com/htefera/Scalable-Data-Science-Assignment-2/tree/master/Clustering)
### [3. Recommednation System](https://github.com/htefera/Scalable-Data-Science-Assignment-2/tree/master/Recommendation%20Systems)
### [4. Spatial Data Analysis](https://github.com/htefera/Scalable-Data-Science-Assignment-2/tree/master/Spatial%20Data%20Analysis)
